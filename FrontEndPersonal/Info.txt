Hi, I name is Kimaren Naidoo. 

A young, enthusiastic and hardworking individual,
who is passionate about software development and has a passion for learning new
things. I consider myself a 'forever student', as I am eager to improve my knowledge.

I understand that hard work and consistency is important principles to become successful.
Hence why I applied these two principles through out my high school and university career,
motivating myself to learn more and becoming a better software developer.

I am always fascinated by breaking down a problem and trying to find the most optimal way to 
solve it. Even with art ,in particular drawing, which I do as a hobby is similar to software
development, both require you to be somewhat creative and build something from the ground up.
