                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi, My name is Kimaren Naidoo.</p>
                <p>A young, enthusiastic and hardworking individual,
                    who is passionate about software development and has a passion for learning new
                    things. I consider myself a 'forever student', as I am eager to improve my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>I understand that hard work and consistency is important principles to become successful.
                    Hence why I applied these two principles through out my high school and university career,
                    motivating myself to learn more and becoming a better software developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am always fascinated by breaking down a problem and trying to find the most optimal way to 
                    solve it. Even with art ,in particular drawing, which I do as a hobby is similar to software
                    development, both require you to be somewhat creative and build something from the ground up. 
                </p>
